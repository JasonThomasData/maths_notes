# Why Press Perturbations Are Not Enough

Even though they’re convenient, press perturbations have fundamental limitations:

- They’re **local** analyses: not just derived from the Jacobian, they're derived from *a particular* equilibrium.
- They describe what happens under small sustained changes, not complete removals.
- If we estimate the effects of press perturbations using the sign of the negative of the inverse of the Jacobian, we're assuming quite specific things about *how, when, how fast* (etc), the perturbation enters the system. Approaching the eradication using ODEs gives us more freedom.

So press ≠ extinction.
