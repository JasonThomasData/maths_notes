# But... Are Press Predictions Still Useful?

That’s what we have to establish.

- Just because the method isn't perfect, doesn’t mean it isn't a useful approximation.
- Ecosystem dynamics at broader, global scales **might** follow the same patterns seen with local dynamics. Sometimes the simple assumption is correct.
- Particularly when we're just asking questions about the *direction* of the change, not its absolute effect, or about relative changes (e.g., which press $j$ has a *larger* effect on species $i$).
- They're not just going to take our word for it.
  - People know how to make policy recommendations using these tools. 
  - They're published in good journals.
  - They've been applied to successful projects. 
  - We have to demonstrate that the obvious answer might not be the correct one.

Also:
- We don’t really have a better alternative yet. Full simulations (e.g., Lotka–Volterra removal experiments) require **full model specification** — often unrealistic.
