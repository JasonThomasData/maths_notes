    "### Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mentioned as a way of fitting $ 1/k $ in the Lloyd-Smith et al article. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is this: Let's say there's a dataset with $ n $ observations. You derive some point estimate, suppose that's the mean. You wish to know the confidence interval for that point estimate, since it's based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Draw $ n $ values from your sample, with replacement. For example, if your sample is $ \\{1,2,4,5,7,8\\} $ then, $ n = 6 $. So, the bootstrapped dataset might be $ \\{1,1,2,4,8,8\\} $.\n",
    "- For each bootstrapped dataset, enter the point estimate into a histogram of point estimates. If it's then mean, then you compute the mean for each bootstrapped dataset and enter that mean into the histogram.\n",
    "- To find the confidence interval of your point estimate, select an interval that covers some $ % $ of the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you would need a way to calculate what $ k $ is. The best I can think of is the methodology set out by Daniel... which relates $ k $ to the mean and variance."
